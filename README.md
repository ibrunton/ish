# ish
A shell from scratch as an exercise

This is an exercise in learning more C, intended as a project that can be extended more or less indefinitely.  It's meant only for my own use.  It may or may not (eventually) become a "real" shell that I can actually use for my day-to-day computing.

The name is derived prosaically from "**[i]**an's **[sh]**ell".

### Licensing
**ish** is released under GPL 3.0, on the off-chance somebody actually finds it interesting enough to use.
